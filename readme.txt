This is an activator for the http://www.aprsmail.org website.
In order to verify your account you must either activate over the airwaves (free).
If you cannot you must pay $4.99 and wait upto 24 hours before you can use the service.

The APRS network is a FREE network for ALL HAM operators and I do not believe they should be charging
for this service.

So this activator will act as an igate and spoof the messages you need to the aprsmail website to activate/verify your account.

Just log into the site goto APRSmail and down to Verify account.
Hit the generate button to get your key, once you have it just run my program.

It will ask your the callsign you registered with as well as your key, enter these into the program.
Then simply wait for the program to complete, if all went well you can now login to the website and utilize the FREE services offered without having to pay for them.

Again mind you APRS is free, the software is FREE, and the access is FREE.
The claim to the charge is to ensure only hams verify online, there shouldn't be a charge to use something free.
Now there isn't.
